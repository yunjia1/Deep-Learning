# Deep-Learning

Projects completed as part of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree program. 

## List of projects

### 1. Predicting Bike-sharing Patterns 

Built a neural network which predicts daily bikesharing patterns. Predictions made are done using past data on the number of riders for each hour of each day from January 1 2011 to December 31 2012. The network built is a two layer network with a hidden layer and output layer. A sigmoid function is used for activations. The training goes through 1350 iterations, uses a learning rate of 0.55, has 3 hidden_nodes and 1 output node. 

Below shows a graph comparing the real data with the patterns predicted through the neural network:

### 2. Landmark Classification & Tagging for Social Media

Wrote an algorithm for Landmark Classification. The project is composed of 4 parts. The algorithm was primarly written from scratch. 

1. Download Datasets and Install Python Modules
2. Create a CNN to Classify Landmarks (from Scratch)
3. Create a CNN to Classify Landmarks (using Transfer Learning)
4. Write Your Landmark Prediction Algorithm
